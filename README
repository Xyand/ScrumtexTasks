General:
ScrumtexTasks is a simple tool that generates printable task notes 
from spreadsheet data. To use it all you need to do is export the
task contents to a CSV file and run the script. The script and its 
templates can be further customized.

Prerequisites (Linux):
    pdftk - Used to combine multiple PDF files into one
    latex-beamer - Latex presentation class
    latex - tex-live, miktex or any other
    python

Usage:
    cat tasks_file.csv | ./MakeTasks.sh folder_out

Format:
By default the CSV file has to contain 5 fields identified by name in 
the first line of the CSV file (see tasks.txt for an example). Currently
the first field must the the task title (mostly user-story). The notes are color grouped by equi-titled tasks.

To specify a list of elements separate them using a hash `#` in a single CSV
field. The hash `#` is not to be used for any other purpose in the CSV.

Customization:
To modify the layout of the note you can edit the Latex templates in 
FrameTemplate.tex and TaskHeader.tex. Every template argument that begin
with a '$' in FrameTemplate.te must be matched by an appropriate field
in the CSV file.
